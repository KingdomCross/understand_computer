# understand_computer
the folder will contain the source code about all  book that I learn the computer.

the all code just I learn the book and the git&github, so maybe it make people confusing, so do not care the detail.

the github is a good thing, at least, I know how many code I write

if it were a tool which can record the time I code, it may be better for me, hahaha.
